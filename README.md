- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @Joe-hitthecode
- üëÄ I love "Linux Kernel" 
- üå± full stack developer
- üíûÔ∏è I'm a computer science major and also a self taught developer 
- üì´ I am available to work on open source project 
- Languages: C#, Python, Javascript/Typescript, Java
- scripting/Design: HTML, CSS, vuejs, reactjs. Figma(prototyping)
- backend- expressjs,django,
- Good software engineering principles

I am not just a programmer. I can explore experimental and data processing using scientific method mostly focus on approximating and reducing error rate in scientific experiments. With my programming skill and knowledge of computing principle I can contribute to scientific experiments that is related to data processing and manipulation in most scientific field. I am fascinated by most thought experiments that blend Psychology, Philosophy and Computer Science. Recently wrote a paper title "Artificial intelligence (AI) is to algorithm; human is to intelligence". In this paper I used some conceptual argument from the chinese room thought experiment to make a point on the limitation of Artificial Intelligence(AI) in comparsion to human Intelligence.

As an technopreneur I created my first software product during my freshmen year as a Computer Science student. I developed a virtual trivial game scoreboard to keep track of player points and performance. Though this product is not commercial but it is open sourced and being use by most high schools in my hometown in Liberia. During my free time I geek out about software product idea and research about gap in the market. With the strong desire to create technological solution to solve real life problem people are faced with I have been working on an app that helps people to learn from Youtube video efficiently. On top of that I keep track of every single bit of information about AI and large language model. I listen to podcasts, read articles, and test out open source large language model and programming libraries that is being released every single day. So far I have tested out over 20 different large language model and AI tools ranging from low level machine learning algorithm to high level api and library. I have recently delved into implementing RAG and fine tuning large language model.

Being a polymath, I have a super power which is having the ability to learn anything. On top of that I have the ability to make connections between complex bodies of knowledge ranging from different field of studies. I am able to borrow idea from most area of learning to make a unified idea. With this I can explore idea on a deeper level and unravel different findings for the purpose developing original concepts. I recently started engaging into photography, while taking pictures and making creative connections I have developed a strong interest in using theoretical concept from imaging and optics to understand the art of taking picture that are driven by precision and the use of  analytical concept like refraction, and understanding how the concept of diffraction influence the sharpness of images with use of different focal lengths.
